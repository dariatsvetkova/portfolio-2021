    "Personal project: a beats-per-minute calculator with a colourful design, used by hundreds of music professionals every month.",
  "role": 
    "Design, development, SEO",
  "tags": ["JavaScript", "jQuery", "HTML", "CSS", "SVG graphics"],
  "urls": {
    "code": "https://github.com/dariatsvetkova/TapTempo",

  },
  "why": 
    "As an extension of my passion for music, I created this beats-per-minute calculator for music professionals. It identifies a song’s tempo when you tap along with it — a feature that is often used in songwriting and recording. A frequent user of BPM calculators myself, I was frustrated with the outdated, clunky interface of those available online at the time. I decided to develop my own calculator with a modern design and intuitive interface. I created music-themed illustrations and wrote a script using JavaScript and jQuery. In addition, I deployed basic SEO that brings an increasing number of users to the website each month.",
  "challenges": 
    "SVG graphics were a big part of this project. I learned the caveats and limitations of this format while applying the images as a responsive CSS background.",
  "lessons": 
    "In this project, I learned the value of using a JavaScript library to save time on programming the common features. It has also proven that quality design is just as important in a web project as functionality."
