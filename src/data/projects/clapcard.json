  "why": 
    "With the COVID pandemic disrupting the international postal service, I could not send a physical birthday card to someone and decided to build a website to use as a birthday card instead. I had a week to come up with something simple but delightful. I decided that clapping hands to interact with a website would provide the needed wow-effect for the recipient and a fun technical challenge for me.",
  "stack":
    "I used JavaScript and Web Audio API to process the microphone input and identify clap sounds in real-time.",
  "challenges": 
    "I did a lot of research across MDN, GitHub and StackOverflow to find a way to access a user's microphone and analyze the sounds. My first instinct was to reach for a library, but none of the solutions I found worked on the client-side. I then discovered the browsers’ built-in Web Audio API and used it to write a script that approximated sound waves’ shape to identify claps.",
  "lessons": 
    "This project has tested my limits in creative problem solving and learning new technology in a short time. My solution is not 100% precise and doesn’t work on mobile due to the way phone microphones compress audio, but the project goal was achieved. Most importantly, the card recipient loved it!"
